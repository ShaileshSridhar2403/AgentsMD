**Differential Diagnoses for Patient Presenting with Severe Splitting Headache, Knee Pain, and Swollen Toes**

1. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Sudden-onset, severe "thunderclap" or splitting headache.
     - Potential neurological symptoms depending on hemorrhage location.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Non-contrast CT Scan of the Head:** High sensitivity for SAH within the first 72 hours.
     - **Lumbar Puncture:** If CT is inconclusive, to detect xanthochromia.
     - **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA):** To identify aneurysms or vascular malformations if SAH is confirmed.

2. **Hypertensive Emergency**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache suggesting possible hypertensive encephalopathy.
     - Potential end-organ damage indicators (e.g., renal impairment, retinal changes).
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Blood Pressure Measurement:** Confirming severely elevated levels (e.g., >180/120 mmHg).
     - **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** To assess for myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias.
     - **Laboratory Tests:** Comprehensive metabolic panel, troponin levels, urinalysis.
     - **Fundoscopic Exam:** To identify hypertensive retinopathy.

3. **Septic Arthritis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Acute knee pain with joint swelling, warmth, and possible redness.
     - Systemic signs such as fever or malaise may be present.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis):** To obtain synovial fluid for Gram stain, culture, cell count, and crystals analysis.
     - **Blood Cultures:** To identify possible hematogenous spread.
     - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show leukocytosis.
     - **C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** Elevated inflammatory markers.

4. **Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Combination of severe headache and joint involvement.
     - Possible multisystem involvement such as renal, skin, or neurological symptoms.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Comprehensive Blood Work:** Including ANCA antibodies (c-ANCA, p-ANCA).
     - **Imaging Studies:** Angiography to detect aneurysms or vessel irregularities.
     - **Biopsy:** Of affected tissue (e.g., skin, nerve) to identify vasculitis.
     - **Urinalysis:** To assess for renal involvement.

5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Joint pain and swelling, potentially involving multiple joints symmetrically (knee, toes).
     - Systemic symptoms like fatigue, which may accompany joint inflammation.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and Anti-CCP Antibodies:** Elevated in RA.
     - **Imaging:** X-rays or MRI of affected joints to assess for joint damage.
     - **CBC and Inflammatory Markers:** Elevated ESR and CRP.
     - **Synovial Fluid Analysis:** To rule out infection or crystal-induced arthritis.

6. **Meningitis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache may be accompanied by neck stiffness, photophobia, and altered mental status.
     - Possible joint pain secondary to systemic infection.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Lumbar Puncture:** To obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis.
     - **Blood Cultures:** To identify causative organisms.
     - **CT Scan of the Head:** If increased intracranial pressure is suspected before lumbar puncture.
     - **CBC and Inflammatory Markers:** Elevated white blood cell count, CRP, and ESR.

7. **Gout**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Acute onset of joint pain and swelling, commonly in the big toe (podagra) and possibly knee.
     - Extreme tenderness and redness of affected joints.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis):** To identify monosodium urate crystals under polarized light microscopy.
     - **Serum Uric Acid Levels:** Elevated, though not definitive.
     - **Imaging:** Ultrasound or dual-energy CT scan can detect urate deposits.

8. **Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache, especially in older adults, possibly with jaw claudication or visual disturbances.
     - May present with systemic inflammatory signs.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** Significantly elevated.
     - **Temporal Artery Biopsy:** Gold standard for diagnosis.
     - **Ultrasound of Temporal Arteries:** To detect arterial inflammation.

9. **Migraine with Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Recurrent severe headaches with possible aura.
     - Secondary musculoskeletal pain, though less common.
   - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
     - **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on headache characteristics and history.
     - **Neuroimaging:** If atypical features are present to rule out secondary causes.

10. **Chikungunya or Other Viral Infections**
    - **Supporting Findings:**
      - Acute headache with joint pain and swelling, often symmetric.
      - History of exposure to endemic areas or vectors.
    - **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
      - **Serologic Testing:** For specific viral antibodies (e.g., Chikungunya, Dengue).
      - **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):** To detect viral RNA during acute phase.
      - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** May show leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
- **Stabilize Patient:**
  - Secure airway, breathing, and circulation.
  - Establish intravenous (IV) access for medication and fluids.
  - Continuous vital sign monitoring every 5-10 minutes.
- **Pain Management:**
  - Administer appropriate analgesics post-physician assessment.
- **Urgent Diagnostic Workup:**
  - Initiate neuroimaging (e.g., CT scan) promptly to rule out SAH or hypertensive emergency.
  - Perform joint aspiration of the knee to evaluate for septic arthritis.
  - Order relevant laboratory tests based on differential considerations.
- **Specialist Consultation:**
  - Involve neurology or neurosurgery for potential SAH.
  - Consult rheumatology or infectious disease as indicated by findings.

**Note:** Given the high-risk nature of potential diagnoses such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and septic arthritis, simultaneous evaluation and prompt initiation of diagnostic protocols are crucial to ensure timely management and prevent morbidity or mortality.
