### Differential Diagnosis for "Incredibly Hungry"

1. **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Extreme hunger (polyphagia) is a classic symptom.
     - Possible underlying hyperglycemia if the patient has a history of diabetes.
     - Potential signs of dehydration or altered mental status might be present upon further evaluation.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Blood Glucose Level:** Elevated levels would support the diagnosis.
     - **Ketones (Blood and Urine):** Presence of ketones confirms ketosis.
     - **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** To assess for metabolic acidosis.
     - **Electrolytes Panel:** To evaluate for electrolyte imbalances common in DKA.

2. **Hypoglycemia**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Sudden onset of extreme hunger can indicate low blood glucose levels.
     - May present with other symptoms such as sweating, shakiness, or confusion.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Fingerstick Blood Glucose:** Immediate measurement to confirm low glucose levels.
     - **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** To identify underlying causes of hypoglycemia.
     - **Insulin and C-Peptide Levels:** If insulinoma or exogenous insulin use is suspected.

3. **Hyperthyroidism (e.g., Thyroid Storm)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Increased appetite is a symptom of hyperthyroidism.
     - May be accompanied by weight loss, heat intolerance, tachycardia, or tremors upon further examination.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):** Elevated T3 and T4 with suppressed TSH would indicate hyperthyroidism.
     - **Thyroid Antibodies:** To identify autoimmune thyroid disease if suspected.
     - **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** To assess for tachycardia or arrhythmias related to hyperthyroidism.

4. **Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Extreme hunger may be present alongside severe hyperglycemia.
     - More common in type 2 diabetes, often without significant ketosis.
     - Patients may present with dehydration and altered mental status.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Blood Glucose Level:** Markedly elevated, often >600 mg/dL.
     - **Serum Osmolality:** Elevated in HHS.
     - **Urinalysis:** To check for glucose and osmolality.
     - **Electrolytes Panel:** To monitor for imbalances due to dehydration.

5. **Gastrointestinal Disorders (e.g., Gastroparesis)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Increased hunger may result from malabsorption or delayed gastric emptying.
     - Possible symptoms include nausea, vomiting, or bloating.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Abdominal Imaging (e.g., Ultrasound, CT Scan):** To identify structural abnormalities.
     - **Gastric Emptying Study:** To assess the rate of gastric emptying.
     - **Endoscopy:** If an upper GI source is suspected.

6. **Psychogenic Causes (e.g., Eating Disorders)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Extreme hunger may be a feature of disorders like bulimia or binge-eating disorder.
     - Possible history of psychiatric conditions or behavioral changes.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional.
     - **Nutritional Assessment:** To evaluate dietary intake and habits.
     - **Laboratory Tests:** To check for electrolyte imbalances or other complications related to eating disorders.

7. **Medication-Induced Increased Appetite**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Use of certain medications (e.g., corticosteroids, antipsychotics) can lead to increased hunger.
     - Review of the patient's medication history is essential.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Medication Review:** Detailed history of current and recent medications.
     - **Hormonal Panels:** If medications affecting appetite hormones (e.g., leptin, ghrelin) are suspected.
     - **Clinical Evaluation:** Assess for side effects related to specific medications.

### Recommended Initial Diagnostic Tests:
- **Vital Signs:** Baseline and every 1-2 hours to monitor hemodynamic status.
- **Point-of-Care Blood Glucose:** Immediate assessment to rule out hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) or Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** To evaluate electrolyte levels, renal function, and blood glucose.
- **Urinalysis:** To check for ketones, glucose, and possible infection.
- **Thyroid Function Tests (if hyperthyroidism is suspected based on initial evaluation).**

### Next Steps:
- **Establish IV Access:** If required for administration of fluids or medications.
- **Symptomatic Treatment:** Address any immediate symptoms as they are identified.
- **Consult Endocrinology or Psychiatry:** Depending on the leading differential after initial evaluation.
