### Differential Diagnoses for Acute Headache (ESI Level 2)

1. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Acute, severe "thunderclap" headache
     - Sudden onset, often described as the "worst headache of life"
     - Possible neck stiffness, photophobia, or loss of consciousness
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Non-contrast CT scan of the head:** High sensitivity within the first 6 hours of symptom onset.
     - **Lumbar puncture:** If CT is negative and suspicion remains high, to detect xanthochromia.

2. **Meningitis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache with possible neck stiffness
     - Fever, photophobia, altered mental status
     - Recent history of infection or exposure
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Lumbar puncture:** To analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for infection markers.
     - **Blood cultures:** To identify causative organisms.
     - **CT scan of the head:** If signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological deficits are present before lumbar puncture.

3. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Acute onset headache, possibly with focal neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, speech difficulties)
     - Sudden neurological deterioration
     - History of hypertension or anticoagulant use
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Non-contrast CT scan of the head:** Rapid identification of hemorrhage.
     - **MRI of the brain:** If CT is inconclusive and clinical suspicion remains.

4. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache, often worse in the morning or with changes in posture
     - Possible seizures, focal neurological deficits, or signs of increased intracranial pressure
     - Risk factors: hypercoagulable states, infection, dehydration
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **MR Venography or CT Venography:** To visualize venous sinuses.
     - **MRI of the brain:** To assess for thrombus and associated brain changes.

5. **Acute Hypertensive Emergency**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache with extremely elevated blood pressure
     - Possible end-organ damage signs (e.g., hypertensive encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhages)
     - History of chronic hypertension
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Blood pressure measurement:** Repeated and accurate assessment.
     - **ECG and blood tests:** To evaluate for cardiac, renal, or other organ involvement.
     - **Brain imaging (CT/MRI):** If neurological symptoms are present.

6. **Migraine Headache**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Moderate to severe headache, often unilateral, pulsating in nature
     - Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia
     - History of similar headaches
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Clinical evaluation:** Diagnosis is primarily clinical based on history and symptomatology.
     - **Neuroimaging:** If atypical features or red flags are present to rule out secondary causes.

7. **Tension-Type Headache**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Dull, aching head pain, bilateral
     - Tightness or pressure around the forehead or back of the head and neck
     - Lack of associated neurological symptoms
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Clinical evaluation:** Based on history and physical examination.
     - **Neuroimaging:** Not typically required unless red flags are present.

8. **Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - New-onset headache in older adults (typically >50 years)
     - Scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, visual disturbances
     - Elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., ESR, CRP)
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Temporal artery biopsy:** Gold standard for diagnosis.
     - **Ultrasound of temporal arteries:** May show characteristic findings.
     - **Blood tests:** Elevated ESR and CRP.

9. **Sinusitis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Headache localized to sinus areas (frontal, maxillary)
     - Congestion, facial pain, purulent nasal discharge
     - Worsening of headache with bending forward
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Clinical evaluation:** Based on history and physical examination.
     - **Sinus imaging (CT scan of sinuses):** If complications are suspected.

10. **Primary Intracranial Tumor**
    - **Supporting Findings:**
      - Progressive headache, worse in the morning or with Valsalva maneuvers
      - Focal neurological deficits, seizures, altered mental status
      - History of malignancy or risk factors for brain tumors
    - **Additional Tests:**
      - **MRI of the brain:** Detailed imaging to identify masses.
      - **CT scan of the head:** If MRI is not immediately available.

### Must-Not-Miss Diagnoses
- **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**
- **Meningitis**
- **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**
- **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis**
- **Acute Hypertensive Emergency**

These conditions require immediate diagnosis and management due to their potential life-threatening nature.

### Recommended Immediate Actions
- **Obtain a detailed history and perform a thorough physical and neurological examination** to identify red flags (e.g., sudden onset, neurological deficits, signs of infection).
- **Initiate appropriate imaging and laboratory tests promptly** based on the leading differential diagnoses.
- **Stabilize the patient** by establishing IV access, monitoring vital signs continuously, and managing pain or other acute symptoms as needed.
