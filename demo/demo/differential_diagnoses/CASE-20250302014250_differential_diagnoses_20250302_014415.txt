### Differential Diagnosis for Severe "Splitting" Headache

1. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Sudden onset of severe, "thunderclap" or "splitting" headache.
     - Potential absence of identifiable stressors despite current stressors.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Non-contrast CT Scan of the Head:** High sensitivity within the first 6 hours of symptom onset.
     - **Lumbar Puncture:** If CT is negative and suspicion remains high, to detect xanthochromia.

2. **Intracranial Mass Lesion (e.g., Brain Tumor)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Progressive headache pattern, possibly worse in the morning or with Valsalva maneuvers.
     - Focal neurological deficits (if present, though not specified in assessment).
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Contrast-Enhanced MRI of the Brain:** To identify mass lesions and assess surrounding structures.
     - **CT Scan with Contrast:** If MRI is contraindicated.

3. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache often accompanied by signs of increased intracranial pressure.
     - Possible risk factors such as recent infection, dehydration, or hypercoagulable states.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **MR Venography or CT Venography:** To visualize venous sinuses and detect thrombosis.
     - **D-dimer Levels:** May support diagnosis if elevated, though not specific.

4. **Meningitis or Encephalitis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache may be accompanied by neck stiffness, fever, photophobia, or altered mental status (not specified but must consider).
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Lumbar Puncture:** To analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for infectious agents.
     - **CT Scan of the Head:** If signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal deficits are present before lumbar puncture.

5. **Pituitary Apoplexy**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Sudden severe headache, often with visual disturbances or ophthalmoplegia.
     - History of known pituitary adenoma (if available).
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **MRI of the Brain with Focus on the Pituitary Gland:** To detect hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary.
     - **Endocrine Function Tests:** To assess hormonal deficiencies.

6. **Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Acute, severe headache with possible history of triggers such as exertion or vasoactive substances.
     - Recurrent headaches over days to weeks.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **CT Angiography or MR Angiography:** To identify segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries.
     - **Lumbar Puncture:** To rule out SAH if imaging is inconclusive.

7. **Acute Hypertensive Crisis**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Extremely high blood pressure readings (if present, not specified in assessment).
     - Headache accompanied by other symptoms like blurred vision or chest pain.
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Blood Pressure Measurement:** Repeated and accurate assessment.
     - **Fundoscopic Exam:** To check for hypertensive retinopathy.
     - **ECG and Blood Work:** To assess end-organ damage.

8. **Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Severe headache in older adults, possibly with jaw claudication or visual changes.
     - Elevated inflammatory markers (if present, not specified).
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** Elevated in most cases.
     - **Temporal Artery Biopsy:** Gold standard for diagnosis.

9. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**
   - **Supporting Findings:**
     - Intense, stabbing pain typically localized to the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.
     - Triggered by touch or movement (less likely to present as "splitting" headache).
   - **Additional Tests:**
     - **MRI of the Brain with Focus on Cranial Nerves:** To identify possible vascular compression or other lesions.
     - **Neurological Examination:** To assess sensory deficits.

10. **Primary Headache Disorders (Migraine, Tension-Type Headache)**
    - **Supporting Findings:**
      - History of similar headaches triggered by stressors such as low sleep or hackathon pressure.
      - Absence of red flag symptoms like focal neurological deficits or altered consciousness.
    - **Additional Tests:**
      - **Clinical Evaluation:** Detailed headache history to differentiate based on characteristics.
      - **Neuroimaging:** Generally not required unless "red flags" are present.

### Recommended Immediate Actions
- **Rapid Diagnostic Imaging:** Perform a non-contrast CT scan of the head urgently to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage and other intracranial pathologies.
- **Comprehensive Neurological Assessment:** Evaluate for any focal neurological signs or signs of increased intracranial pressure.
- **Laboratory Tests:** Depending on findings, consider blood tests such as CBC, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers.
- **Consult Neurosurgery/Neurology:** If SAH or another critical condition is suspected based on initial tests.
